## Description
* Handwritten Digit Recognition ðŸ”¢:
    * Using the Support Vector Machines algorithm Handwritten Digit Recognition is created where user has to submit 28x28       px of image and using the training model it will predict the digit uploaded by the user.
    * For training of the model mnist dataset is used. The success rate of the trained model is `98%`.
