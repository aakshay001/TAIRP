## Description
This repository contains the projects completed during the Artificial Intelligence Internship at Tech-A-Intern Internship Program.
Projects completed during the Internship:

* [Handwritten Digit Recogination](Handwritten_Digit_Recogination): Handwritten Digit Recognition üî¢
Using Support Vector Machines Handwritten Digit Recognition is created where user has to submit 48X48 px of image and using the training model it will predict the digit uploaded by the user. For training of the model mnist dataset is used. The success rate of the trained model is `98%`.


* [Image Classification](Image_Classification): Image Classification üñºÔ∏è Using TensorFlow and open-cv library Image Classification model is created where user has to submit an image and using the training model it will classify what is in the image is it car, bird, horse, deer or any other thing. For training of the model cifar10 dataset is used. The success rate of the trained model is 87%.
